# 1 - enter backend
cd backend
# 2 first option - create a virtual environment
conda create -n phospho-env python=3.11
# 2 second option - create a virtual environment
python -m venv
# 3 - install poetry
pip install poetry
# 4 - install backend dependancies
poetry install
```

### Run tests

1. Make sure you have setup your environment variables. To load the .env files:

   ```
   set -o allexport; source .env; set +o allexport
   ```

2. Start the local server in test mode :

   ```bash
   poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

3. Run tests through poetry

   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

## Services to set up

### Install MongoDB local

We use MongoDB Atlas to host the database in the cloud.

However, if you want to experiment more, you can setup MongoDB on your own computer. [Install MongoDB locally to have your own local database.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew update
brew install mongodb-community@7.0
```

Add the MongoDB as a backend service

```bash
brew services start mongodb-community@7.0
```

Disable telemetry for privacy reasons

```bash
mongosh
disableTelemetry()
```

When running `mongosh`, you'll see a URL. Note it down.

```text
Connecting to:		mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&appName=mongosh+2.1.1
Using MongoDB:		7.0.2
Using Mongosh:		2.1.1
```

In the Python backend, we use the async client [Motor](https://motor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial-asyncio.html). Async lets the backend do stuff while it's waiting for the db response.

In tests and other scripts, you can use [Pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html). It is synchronous and installed when you install Motor. It's useful when you need to wait for the response anyways.

### Run backend server

```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Deployment

This app is packaged in a Docker container and is deployed with github actions.

- The step by step is available in the [github workflow backend-deploy](../.github/workflows/backend-deploy.yml)
- Build step are executed in GCP with [cloud build](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/builds/submit)
- Tool for building: [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko). This is useful for caching. See [cloudbuild.yaml](./cloudbuild.yaml) for configuration.
- Tool for the build steps: Docker. See the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) for how the execution environment is packaged.

## Stripe

To get stripe working on your local development server, you need to setup the stripe webhook locally, for that, run the following command and update your stripe-webhook-secret

```rb
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/organizations/stripe-webhook
```

### Populate the local test database

Run :

```
python scripts/populate_local_db.py
```

You will be prompted for your API key and project id (TEST env of propelAuth)

## To decide

At which level do we handle the try excepts? Service level? db level?
Timestamp format? Typing (str or int)?

## Common issues

Pydantic models make the app crash if a field value is None and the field is not Optional.
