## Summary

### Situation before

### What's here now

## Check list

- [ ] typing, linting, docstrings (cicd will fail)
- [ ] If adding an external service, include the relevant API keys in deployment scripts in `.github/workflows` (staging and prod) and GH actions
- [ ] If changing data models in `phospho-python` that are used in the backend, run `poetry lock` in `phospho-python` so the `backend` tests CICD cache is invalidated
- [ ] If creating an API endpoint, add it to `v3` so that you can easily document it in `docs.phospho.ai`
