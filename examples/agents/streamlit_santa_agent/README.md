# Deploy your own version of the Santa chatbot

The goal of this chatbot is to show how you can use phospho to monitor the user interactions with your chatbot.

## Local deployment

Create `secrets.toml` in the `.streamlit` folder.

```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID=...
PHOSPHO_API_KEY=...
PHOSPHO_BASE_URL=...
```

You need an OpenAI key and a phospho account.

Run the frontend the following way:

```bash
cd streamlit_santa_agent # Make sure you are in this repository
streamlit run frontend.py
```

## Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud

The easiest way to deploy the chatbot on internet is with Streamlit Community Cloud.

### Setup Streamlit

Fork the [phospho repository](https://github.com/phospho-app/phospho) while connected to your github account.

Login or register to [Streamlit share](https://share.streamlit.io) with the same github account

On Streamlit share, click on "New App".

In the form, select your fork of the phospho repo. If you don't see the repo in the list, you can paste the URL.

In the main file path, enter `examples/streamlit-santa-agent/frontend.py`

PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID=...
PHOSPHO_API_KEY=...
```
